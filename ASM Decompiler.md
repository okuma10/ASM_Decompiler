Following ComputerEnhance.com homework for Part01-reading ASM, where we are asked to do an Binary->Assembly decompiler to understand the basics of ASM.
This is my take on it(probably not the best), but you can find the intel spec for 8086 in the resources. As well as a neat table I found on github showing how to identify an opCode based on it's `Hi` and `Lo` bits.
